# MGSResolutionPatch

**UPDATE 2023/10/29**: Fixed UI bugs in MGS2 (including codec calls)

This is an experimental ASI Plugin for Steam releases of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3.
It allows to change ingame resolution via ini config.

Recommended for play at resolutions 1920x1080, 2560x1440 and 3840x2160.
Resolutions other than above mentioned are not guaranteed to produce an adequate image (it might be stretched), but I didn't test every possible resolution that is out there, so you might as well try whatever resolution you want.

## Installation

1. Download the latest Ultimate ASI Loader from here: https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/download/x64-latest/d3d11-x64.zip
