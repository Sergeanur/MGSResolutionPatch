# MGSResolutionPatch

This is an experimental ASI Plugin for Steam releases of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3.
It allows to change ingame resolution via ini config.

Recommended for play with MGS 3 at resolutions 1920x1080 and 3840x2160.
The plugin is compatible with MGS 2, however increased resolution introduces noticeable bugs to the UI.
Resolutions other than 1920x1080 and 3840x2160 are not guaranteed to produce an adequate image (it might be stretched), but I didn't test every possible resolution that is out there, so you might as well try whatever resolution you want.
